<h2 align = 'center'>   Introduction
</h2>
Energy is the lifeblood of modern infrastructure, powering industries, transportation, and communities. The quality and accessibility of energy resources are intrinsically linked to infrastructure development. As the world grapples with an infrastructure deficit, compounded by environmental concerns, a transformation is essential. This project explores the interplay between energy and infrastructure, aligning with the theme of "Infrastructure Deficit: AI's Transformative Role in Planning."

<h2 align = 'center'>   Problem Statement
</h2>
The problem at hand is the urgent need to transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources to address infrastructure deficits sustainably. Non-renewable energy exacerbates environmental challenges and hampers infrastructure growth. It's critical to understand renewable energy trends, barriers, and the path to eliminating non-renewables.
