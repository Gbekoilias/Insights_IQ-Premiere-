4 of these datasets outline the quantity of terawatt hours (TWh) produced through various sources of energy, comparing both renewable and non-renewable sources, while highlighting the renewable use of the top 20 countries. The Renewables Power Generation dataset includes a 1997-2017 timeline that outlines the progress of the main renewable energy sectors : Hydro, Wind, Biofuel, Solar PV, and Geothermal. Additionally, the Top 20 Countries Power Generation dataset includes the national data for each of the renewable categories as outlined above. The last 2 datasets include the global TWh generated from renewable and non-renewable sources.
In the latest version, I added two datasets which contain the global consumption figures on national and continental/international group levels, which help provide context about the quantity of energy required, how that is changing over time, and how we are doing in terms of transitioning from non-renewable to renewable energy use.

As temperatures rise and storms grow more fierce, improving the efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy sources is critical. In turn, understanding which nations are leading the way and which require more immediate transformations will help target efforts and hopefully, reach global goals.
Which types of renewables are improving the fastest? Which countries using which types of renewables? At the increasing rate of returns on renewables, how long will it take to meet global demands and eliminate non-renewables, or atleast, break 50%?
