<h2 align = 'center'>   Introduction
</h2>
Energy is the lifeblood of modern infrastructure, a vital force that drives industries, propels transportation systems, and sustains the livelihoods of communities worldwide. Inextricably linked to infrastructure development, the quality and accessibility of energy resources underpin the functioning and growth of societies. As the global community confronts the daunting challenge of an infrastructure deficit, compounded by pressing environmental concerns, transformation becomes not merely desirable but imperative. The urgent need to reimagine and revitalize our infrastructure coincides with a paradigm shift towards sustainability and efficiency in energy systems. This project embarks on a multifaceted exploration of the intricate relationship between energy and infrastructure, contributing to the overarching theme of "Infrastructure Deficit: AI's Transformative Role in Planning."

In the face of mounting infrastructure demands and the critical imperative to reduce our environmental footprint, the interplay between energy and infrastructure takes center stage. By delving into this complex synergy, we aspire to unearth data-driven insights that illuminate the path toward sustainable infrastructure development. The convergence of renewable energy, technological innovation, and artificial intelligence offers a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of intelligent infrastructure planning. Through this project, we endeavor to provide meaningful solutions, promote informed decision-making, and offer actionable recommendations, all with the shared goal of ushering in a more sustainable and resilient future for our global infrastructure landscape.

<h2 align = 'center'>   Problem Statement
</h2>
At the crux of the challenge lies the imperative to swiftly shift from non-renewable to renewable energy sources, a pivotal step in addressing infrastructure deficits while upholding environmental sustainability. Non-renewable energy sources not only contribute to environmental degradation but also serve as a roadblock to infrastructure expansion. The pressing need is to unravel the intricate dynamics of renewable energy trends, identify barriers obstructing their adoption, and pave the way towards a future where non-renewables are eliminated. This transformation is not merely an option but a critical stride toward fostering sustainable infrastructure and mitigating the adverse environmental impacts linked with conventional energy sources.
