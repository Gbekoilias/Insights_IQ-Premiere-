4 of these datasets outline the quantity of terawatt hours (TWh) produced through various sources of energy, comparing both renewable and non-renewable sources, while highlighting the renewable use of the top 20 countries. The Renewables Power Generation dataset includes a 1997-2017 timeline that outlines the progress of the main renewable energy sectors : Hydro, Wind, Biofuel, Solar PV, and Geothermal. Additionally, the Top 20 Countries Power Generation dataset includes the national data for each of the renewable categories as outlined above. The last 2 datasets include the global TWh generated from renewable and non-renewable sources.
In the latest version, I added two datasets which contain the global consumption figures on national and continental/international group levels, which help provide context about the quantity of energy required, how that is changing over time, and how we are doing in terms of transitioning from non-renewable to renewable energy use.
